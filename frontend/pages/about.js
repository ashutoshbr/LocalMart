      The market for e-commerce sites has enormous potential as a result of Nepal explosion in the number of internet users and digital payment methods. There were 822 thousand more internet users in Nepal between 2021 and 2022.
      Peoples purchasing and use of goods and services has changed since the advent of e-commerce. People are increasingly using computers and other electronic devices to place orders for items that will be delivered to their homes. As a result, the retail environment has shifted. The massive success of Daraz and SastoDeal has caused traditional retailers to change their business practices. eCommerce transactions are expected to increase from 14.1 per cent to 22 per cent by 2023. According to these projections, the e-commerce industry has yet to reach its full potential.

    <p className="p-4">
      With functionality and practicality being the key factors tied to time constraints, we intend to keep our project on a limited scale for the time being, focusing only on providing a platform for locals to promote their items to thousands of online consumers. Our main goal is to broaden our knowledge and skills in web development and database management, as well as to practically design an appealing UI and UX so that our users can easily see and find their preferred products. However, to attain this goal as successfully as possible, we must first set certain pre-planned objectives before beginning the actual activity.
